  **Design Movement**: "Swiss Style / International Typographic Style" (Modernized)
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Objective Clarity**: Content is king. The design should recede to let the data and resume details shine.
  2. **Asymmetry**: Use asymmetric layouts to create dynamic tension and interest without clutter.
  3. **Mathematical Grids**: Everything aligns to a strict grid, but elements can span multiple columns for emphasis.
  4. **Hierarchy**: Use size and weight to guide the eye instantly to the most important information.

  **Color Philosophy**: 
  - **Navy Blue (#001f3f)**: Represents trust, intelligence, and stability (requested by user).
  - **Teal Accent (#39CCCC)**: Adds a touch of energy and modernity without being overwhelming.
  - **White/Light Gray**: Extensive use of whitespace to create breathing room.
  - *Reasoning*: This palette screams "professional" and "reliable" but the teal adds that "data-driven innovation" vibe.

  **Layout Paradigm**: 
  - **Split Screen / Asymmetric Grid**: Home page features a split layout (text left, image right/below).
  - **Card-Based**: Dashboard showcase uses clean cards with subtle shadows to mimic a physical dashboard.
  - **Sticky Navigation**: Keeps the user oriented.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Bold Typography**: Large, sans-serif headings (e.g., Helvetica Now or Inter) for impact.
  - **Geometric Shapes**: Subtle geometric overlays (circles, squares) in the background to hint at data points.
  - **Data Visualization Motifs**: Small, abstract charts or graphs as decorative elements.

  **Interaction Philosophy**: 
  - **Micro-interactions**: Buttons slightly lift on hover.
  - **Smooth Scroll**: Navigation links glide to sections.
  - **Data Reveal**: Dashboard charts animate in (bars grow, lines draw) to show the "live" nature of data.

  **Animation**:
  - **Fade-in Up**: Elements slide up and fade in as the user scrolls.
  - **Hover Effects**: Cards scale up slightly (1.02x) on hover.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: **Inter** (Bold/Extra Bold) - Clean, modern, ubiquitous in tech.
  - **Body**: **Inter** (Regular/Medium) - Highly readable.
  - **Monospace**: **JetBrains Mono** or **Fira Code** for code snippets or data labels.

  **Design Movement**: "Tech Minimalist / Bauhaus"

  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Form Follows Function**: Every element serves a purpose. No decoration for decoration's sake.
  2. **Reductionism**: Strip away non-essentials.
  3. **Geometric Purity**: Use simple shapes (circles, rectangles) to construct the UI.
  4. **Contrast**: High contrast between text and background for readability.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Deep Charcoal (#222222)**: A softer alternative to black for text.
  - **Electric Blue (#007AFF)**: High-energy accent color for primary actions.
  - **Off-White (#F5F5F7)**: Warmer background to avoid clinical sterility.
  - *Reasoning*: Mimics the clean, high-tech aesthetic of modern SaaS platforms.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Single Column Focus**: Resume and content sections are centered for maximum readability.
  - **Modular Grid**: Dashboard section uses a strict modular grid for charts.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Thick Borders**: Sections separated by visible, thick lines.
  - **Monochromatic Icons**: Simple, outline-style icons.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Instant Feedback**: Buttons change color instantly on click.
  - **Minimal Motion**: Transitions are fast and sharp (0.2s).

  **Animation**:
  - **Slide-in**: Side navigation or drawers slide in from the edge.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: **Roboto** (Bold) - Geometric and mechanical.
  - **Body**: **Roboto** (Regular).

  **Design Movement**: "Soft UI / Neomorphism" (Subtle)

  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Softness**: Rounded corners, soft shadows, blurred backgrounds.
  2. **Depth**: Elements appear to be extruded from the background.
  3. **Tactility**: UI feels touchable and friendly.
  4. **Light**: Use light and shadow to define shapes.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Slate Blue (#4A90E2)**: Calming and professional.
  - **Pale Gray (#EBECF0)**: The base for the soft UI effect.
  - **Soft White**: For highlights.
  - *Reasoning*: Creates a very approachable and friendly vibe, fitting for the "dog lover" persona.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Floating Cards**: Content sits on cards that float above the background.
  - **Centered Layout**: Content is centered with ample margins.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Soft Shadows**: Multiple drop shadows to create depth.
  - **Rounded Corners**: Large border-radius (16px+).

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Press Effect**: Buttons appear to be pressed into the screen on click.

  **Animation**:
  - **Float**: Gentle floating animation for hero image.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: **Nunito** (Bold) - Rounded sans-serif.
  - **Body**: **Nunito** (Regular).

# Selected Approach: Modernized Swiss Style (Idea 1)

I will proceed with the **Modernized Swiss Style**. This aligns perfectly with the user's request for a "professional, simple, trustworthy, and modern" look. The focus on clarity, hierarchy, and grid-based layouts suits a data analyst portfolio where information (resume, dashboards) needs to be digested easily. The Navy Blue and Teal palette is professional yet modern.

**Design Philosophy Statement**:
"We will adopt a Modernized Swiss Style, prioritizing objective clarity, asymmetric balance, and a strong typographic hierarchy. The design will use a professional Navy Blue and Teal palette to convey trust and innovation. Content will be organized in a clean, grid-based layout with subtle data-inspired motifs, ensuring that Jiyeon's experience and insights take center stage."
